# Hyprland dotfiles

These are my dotfiles for my personal Hypr setup, so they probably won't work perfectly for you, but I put them here because they might be useful or interesting to look at, and can be modified to work properly.

They're mostly modified and formed from @end-4's setup at https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland. I changed visual stuff and made it more tolerable to use, so nothing too major, just a lot of fixes. If you're interested in my illogical-impulse setup (.config/quickshell/ii) which has some new features and removes the AI garbage and weeb shit you can find them at my repository too.
