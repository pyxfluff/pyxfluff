I'm Pyx, a full stack developer in 5+ languages and UI/UX designer. I mainly program in Lua, Python, TypeScript, and HTML + SASS (yes HTML is programming). 

Aside from being a poor attempt at a software engineer I am a game developer in Roblox and Unreal.


## Active Websites

Currently, I run the following websites:

## Other noteworthy stuff

I [love listening to music](https://www.last.fm/user/pyxfluff). Roughly 300 albums and counting. Some artists I really like in specific are Nothing but Thieves and Everything Everything with some other music mixed in the mixes (a lot of twenty one pilots).
I started programming in 2017 with Roblox and have long since expanded to programming with other things.

Thanks for checking my profile out! For more information feel free [to check my main website out.](https://notpyx.me)
