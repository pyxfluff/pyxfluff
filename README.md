# Hello!

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">

  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
    I'm Pyx, a full stack developer in 5+ languages and UI/UX designer. I have experience in Roblox Studio and Unreal Engine.

    I'm experienced in Lua, Python, JavaScript, and HTML. Need to reach me? Do it via my Twitter or Discord.

## Other noteworthy stuff

I [love listening to music](https://www.last.fm/user/pyxfluff). Roughly 300 albums and counting. Some artists I really like in specific are Nothing but Thieves and Everything Everything.  
I started programming in 2017 with Roblox and have long since expanded to programming with other things.

Thanks for checking my profile out! Please don't have a stroke at how I format my code.
