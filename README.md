## Other noteworthy stuff

I [love listening to music](https://www.last.fm/user/pyxfluff). Roughly 350 albums and counting. Some artists I really like in specific are Nothing but Thieves and Everything Everything.
I started programming in 2017 with Roblox and have long since expanded to programming with other things.
