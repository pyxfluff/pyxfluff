I'm Pyx, a full stack developer, UI/UX designer, and sysadmin. I mainly program in Lua, Python, TypeScript, HTML + SASS (yes HTML is programming), and Bash. 

Aside from being somewhat of a software engineer I am a game developer, primarily in the Roblox engine with a little bit of unofficial Unreal. I also do a lot of system administration (mostly with Proxmox but I do a lot of other stuff) because it's what I'm looking to do professionally.

I [love listening to music](https://www.last.fm/user/pyxfluff), with ~250 albums in my library (and counting). Some artists I really like in specific are Nothing but Thieves, Everything Everything, and twenty one pilots with some other music mixed in the mixes (my taste is all over the place).

I first learned to program in 2017 with Luau in Roblox and it's still my best language to date because of its simplicity.

I am also the main developer and maintainer of [Administer](https://github.com/administer-org), a modular and open administration standard for Roblox.

You can find some of my dotfiles and useful scripts in my self-titled [repository.](https://github.com/pyxfluff/pyxfluff)
